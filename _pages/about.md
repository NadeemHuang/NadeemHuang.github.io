Hi, I’m Nadeem Huang, a Computer Engineering student at Virginia Tech with a passion for embedded and software systems. I love tackling complex technical challenges and finding innovative solutions that bridge hardware and software.

Beyond academics, I thrive in collaborative environments, whether it's working on embedded systems for spaceflight experiments through the RockSat-X program or competing in team sports like volleyball. When I’m not coding or problem-solving, you’ll likely find me hiking and exploring the outdoors.

I’m always eager to learn, grow, and apply my skills to real-world problems. If you’re interested in connecting or collaborating, feel free to reach out!

Ut prosim.
